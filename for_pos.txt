Chapter 7 .
On the fifth day -- again , as always , it was thanks to the sheep -- the secret of the little prince 's life was revealed to me .
Abruptly , without anything to lead up to it , and as if the question had been born of long and silent meditation on his problem , he demanded : " A sheep -- if it eats little bushes , does it eat flowers , too ? "
" A sheep , "
I answered , " eats anything it finds in its reach . "
" Even flowers that have thorns ? "
" Yes , even flowers that have thorns . "
" Then the thorns -- what use are they ? "
I did not know .
At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine .
I was very much worried , for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious .
And I had so little drinking - water left that I had to fear for the worst .
" The thorns - - what use are they ? "
The little prince never let go of a question , once he had asked it .
As for me , I was upset over that bolt .
And I answered with the first thing that came into my head : " The thorns are of no use at all .
Flowers have thorns just for spite ! "
" Oh ! "
There was a moment of complete silence .
Then the little prince flashed back at me , with a kind of resentfulness : " I do n't believe you !
Flowers are weak creatures .
They are naïve .
They reassure themselves as best they can .
They believe that their thorns are terrible weapons ... "
I did not answer .
At that instant I was saying to myself : " If this bolt still will n't turn , I am going to knock it out with the hammer . "
Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts .
" And you actually believe that the flowers - - "
" Oh , no ! "
I cried .
" No , no no !
I do n't believe anything .
I answered you with the first thing that came into my head .
Do n't you see - - I am very busy with matters of consequence ! "
He stared at me , thunderstruck .
" Matters of consequence ! "
He looked at me there , with my hammer in my hand , my fingers black with engine - grease , bending down over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly ...
" You talk just like the grown - ups ! "
That made me a little ashamed .
But he went on , relentlessly : " You mix everything up together ...
You confuse everything ... "
He was really very angry .
He tossed his golden curls in the breeze .
" I know a planet where there is a certain red - faced gentleman .
He has never smelled a flower .
He has never looked at a star .
He has never loved any one .
He has never done anything in his life but add up figures .
And all day he says over and over , just like you : ' I am busy with matters of consequence ! ' And that makes him swell up with pride .
But he is not a man - - he is a mushroom ! "
" A what ? "
" A mushroom ! "
The little prince was now white with rage .
" The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years .
For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same .
And is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to them ?
Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not important ?
Is this not of more consequence than a fat red - faced gentleman 's sums ?
And if I know - - I , myself - - one flower which is unique in the world , which grows nowhere but on my planet , but which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning , without even noticing what he is doing - - Oh !
You think that is not important ! "
His face turned from white to red as he continued : " If some one loves a flower , of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars , it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars .
He can say to himself , ' Somewhere , my flower is there ... ' But if the sheep eats the flower , in one moment all his stars will be darkened ...
And you think that is not important ! "
He could not say anything more .
His words were choked by sobbing .
The night had fallen .
I had let my tools drop from my hands .
Of what moment now was my hammer , my bolt , or thirst , or death ?
On one star , one planet , my planet , the Earth , there was a little prince to be comforted .
I took him in my arms , and rocked him .
I said to him : " The flower that you love is not in danger .
I will draw you a muzzle for your sheep .
I will draw you a railing to put around your flower .
I will - - "
I did not know what to say to him .
I felt awkward and blundering .
I did not know how I could reach him , where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more .
It is such a secret place , the land of tears .
Chapter 8 .
I soon learned to know this flower better .
On the little prince 's planet the flowers had always been very simple .
They had only one ring of petals ; they took up no room at all ; they were a trouble to nobody .
One morning they would appear in the grass , and by night they would have faded peacefully away .
But one day , from a seed blown from no one knew where , a new flower had come up ; and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet .
It might , you see , have been a new kind of baobab .
The shrub soon stopped growing , and began to get ready to produce a flower .
The little prince , who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud , felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it .
But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber .
She chose her colours with the greatest care .
She adjusted her petals one by one .
She did not wish to go out into the world all rumpled , like the field poppies .
It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to appear .
Oh , yes !
She was a coquettish creature !
And her mysterious adornment lasted for days and days .
Then one morning , exactly at sunrise , she suddenly showed herself .
And , after working with all this painstaking precision , she yawned and said : " Ah !
I am scarcely awake .
I beg that you will excuse me .
My petals are still all disarranged ... "
But the little prince could not restrain his admiration : " Oh !
How beautiful you are ! "
" Am I not ? " the flower responded , sweetly .
" And I was born at the same moment as the sun ... "
The little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest - - but how moving - - and exciting - - she was !
" I think it is time for breakfast , " she added an instant later .
" If you would have the kindness to think of my needs - - "
And the little prince , completely abashed , went to look for a sprinkling - can of fresh water .
So , he tended the flower .
So , too , she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity - - which was , if the truth be known , a little difficult to deal with .
One day , for instance , when she was speaking of her four thorns , she said to the little prince : " Let the tigers come with their claws ! "
" There are no tigers on my planet , " the little prince objected .
" And , anyway , tigers do not eat weeds . "
" I am not a weed , " the flower replied , sweetly .
" Please excuse me ... "
" I am not at all afraid of tigers , " she went on , " but I have a horror of drafts .
I suppose you would n't have a screen for me ? "
" A horror of drafts - - that is bad luck , for a plant , " remarked the little prince , and added to himself , " This flower is a very complex creature ... "
" At night I want you to put me under a glass globe .
It is very cold where you live .
In the place I came from - - "
But she interrupted herself at that point .
She had come in the form of a seed .
She could not have known anything of any other worlds .
Embarassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such a naïve untruth , she coughed two or three times , in order to put the little prince in the wrong .
" The screen ? "
" I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me ... "
Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same .
So the little prince , in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love , had soon come to doubt her .
He had taken seriously words which were without importance , and it made him very unhappy .
" I ought not to have listened to her , " he confided to me one day . "
One never ought to listen to the flowers .
One should simply look at them and breathe their fragrance .
Mine perfumed all my planet .
But I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace .
This tale of claws , which disturbed me so much , should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity . "
And he continued his confidences : " The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything !
I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words .
She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me .
I ought never to have run away from her ...
I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little strategems .
Flowers are so inconsistent !
But I was too young to know how to love her ... "
Chapter 9 .
I believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds .
On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order .
He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes .
He possessed two active volcanoes ; and they were very convenient for heating his breakfast in the morning .
He also had one volcano that was extinct .
But , as he said , " One never knows ! "
So he cleaned out the extinct volcano , too .
If they are well cleaned out , volcanoes burn slowly and steadily , without any eruptions .
Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney .
On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes .
That is why they bring no end of trouble upon us .
The little prince also pulled up , with a certain sense of dejection , the last little shoots of the baobabs .
He believed that he would never want to return .
But on this last morning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him .
And when he watered the flower for the last time , and prepared to place her under the shelter of her glass globe , he realised that he was very close to tears .
" Goodbye , " he said to the flower .
But she made no answer .
" Goodbye , " he said again .
The flower coughed .
But it was not because she had a cold .
" I have been silly , " she said to him , at last .
" I ask your forgiveness .
Try to be happy ... "
He was surprised by this absence of reproaches .
He stood there all bewildered , the glass globe held arrested in mid - air .
He did not understand this quiet sweetness .
" Of course I love you , " the flower said to him .
" It is my fault that you have not known it all the while .
That is of no importance .
But you - - you have been just as foolish as I .
Try to be happy ... let the glass globe be .
I do n't want it any more . "
" But the wind - - "
" My cold is not so bad as all that ... the cool night air will do me good .
I am a flower . "
" But the animals - - "
" Well , I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies .
It seems that they are very beautiful .
And if not the butterflies - - and the caterpillars - - who will call upon me ?
You will be far away ... as for the large animals - - I am not at all afraid of any of them .
I have my claws . "
And , naïvely , she showed her four thorns .
Then she added : " Do n't linger like this .
You have decided to go away .
Now go ! "
For she did not want him to see her crying .
She was such a proud flower ...
Chapter 10 .
He found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325 , 326 , 327 , 328 , 329 , and 330 .
He began , therefore , by visiting them , in order to add to his knowledge .
The first of them was inhabited by a king .
Clad in royal purple and ermine , he was seated upon a throne which was at the same time both simple and majestic .
" Ah !
Here is a subject , " exclaimed the king , when he saw the little prince coming .
And the little prince asked himself : " How could he recognize me when he had never seen me before ? "
He did not know how the world is simplified for kings .
To them , all men are subjects .
" Approach , so that I may see you better , " said the king , who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebody .
The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down ; but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king 's magnificent ermine robe .
So he remained standing upright , and , since he was tired , he yawned .
" It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king , " the monarch said to him .
" I forbid you to do so . "
" I can n't help it .
I can n't stop myself , " replied the little prince , thoroughly embarrassed .
" I have come on a long journey , and I have had no sleep ... "
" Ah , then , " the king said .
" I order you to yawn .
It is years since I have seen anyone yawning .
Yawns , to me , are objects of curiosity .
Come , now !
Yawn again !
It is an order . "
" That frightens me ...
I can not , any more ... " murmured the little prince , now completely abashed .
" Hum !
Hum ! " replied the king .
" Then I - - I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to - - "
He sputtered a little , and seemed vexed .
For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his authority should be respected .
He tolerated no disobedience .
He was an absolute monarch .
But , because he was a very good man , he made his orders reasonable .
" If I ordered a general , " he would say , by way of example , " if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird , and if the general did not obey me , that would not be the fault of the general .
It would be my fault . "
" May I sit down ? " came now a timid inquiry from the little prince .
" I order you to do so , " the king answered him , and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle .
But the little prince was wondering ...
The planet was tiny .
Over what could this king really rule ?
" Sire , " he said to him , " I beg that you will excuse my asking you a question - - "
" I order you to ask me a question , " the king hastened to assure him .
" Sire - - over what do you rule ? "
" Over everything , " said the king , with magnificent simplicity .
" Over everything ? "
The king made a gesture , which took in his planet , the other planets , and all the stars .
" Over all that ? " asked the little prince .
" Over all that , " the king answered .
For his rule was not only absolute : it was also universal .
" And the stars obey you ? "
" Certainly they do , " the king said .
" They obey instantly .
I do not permit insubordination . "
Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at .
If he had been master of such complete authority , he would have been able to watch the sunset , not forty - four times in one day , but seventy - two , or even a hundred , or even two hundred times , without ever having to move his chair .
And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet which he had forsaken , he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favor : " I should like to see a sunset ... do me that kindness ...
Order the sun to set ... "
" If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly , or to write a tragic drama , or to change himself into a sea bird , and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received , which one of us would be in the wrong ? " the king demanded .
" The general , or myself ? "
" You , " said the little prince firmly .
" Exactly .
One much require from each one the duty which each one can perform , " the king went on .
" Accepted authority rests first of all on reason .
If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea , they would rise up in revolution .
I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable . "
" Then my sunset ? " the little prince reminded him : for he never forgot a question once he had asked it .
" You shall have your sunset .
I shall command it .
But , according to my science of government , I shall wait until conditions are favorable . "
" When will that be ? " inquired the little prince .
" Hum !
Hum ! " replied the king ; and before saying anything else he consulted a bulky almanac .
" Hum !
Hum !
That will be about - - about - - that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight .
And you will see how well I am obeyed . "
The little prince yawned .
He was regretting his lost sunset .
And then , too , he was already beginning to be a little bored .
" I have nothing more to do here , " he said to the king .
" So I shall set out on my way again . "
" Do not go , " said the king , who was very proud of having a subject .
" Do not go .
I will make you a Minister ! "
" Minister of what ? "
" Minster of - - of Justice ! "
" But there is nobody here to judge ! "
" We do not know that , " the king said to him .
" I have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom .
I am very old .
There is no room here for a carriage .
And it tires me to walk . "
" Oh , but I have looked already ! " said the little prince , turning around to give one more glance to the other side of the planet .
On that side , as on this , there was nobody at all ...
" Then you shall judge yourself , " the king answered .
" that is the most difficult thing of all .
It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others .
If you succeed in judging yourself rightly , then you are indeed a man of true wisdom . "
" Yes , " said the little prince , " but I can judge myself anywhere .
I do not need to live on this planet .
" Hum !
Hum ! " said the king .
" I have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat .
I hear him at night .
You can judge this old rat .
From time to time you will condemn him to death .
Thus his life will depend on your justice .
But you will pardon him on each occasion ; for he must be treated thriftily .
He is the only one we have . "
" I , " replied the little prince , " do not like to condemn anyone to death .
And now I think I will go on my way . "
" No , " said the king .
But the little prince , having now completed his preparations for departure , had no wish to grieve the old monarch .
" If Your Majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed , " he said , " he should be able to give me a reasonable order .
He should be able , for example , to order me to be gone by the end of one minute .
It seems to me that conditions are favorable ... "
As the king made no answer , the little prince hesitated a moment .
Then , with a sigh , he took his leave .
" I made you my Ambassador , " the king called out , hastily .
He had a magnificent air of authority .
" The grown - ups are very strange , " the little prince said to himself , as he continued on his journey .
Chapter 11 .
The second planet was inhabited by a conceited man .
" Ah !
Ah !
I am about to receive a visit from an admirer ! " he exclaimed from afar , when he first saw the little prince coming .
For , to conceited men , all other men are admirers .
" Good morning , " said the little prince .
" That is a queer hat you are wearing . "
" It is a hat for salutes , " the conceited man replied .
" It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me .
Unfortunately , nobody at all ever passes this way . "
" Yes ? " said the little prince , who did not understand what the conceited man was talking about .
" Clap your hands , one against the other , " the conceited man now directed him .
The little prince clapped his hands .
The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute .
" This is more entertaining than the visit to the king , " the little prince said to himself .
And he began again to clap his hands , one against the other .
The conceited man against raised his hat in salute .
After five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew tired of the game 's monotony .
" And what should one do to make the hat come down ? " he asked .
But the conceited man did not hear him .
Conceited people never hear anything but praise .
" Do you really admire me very much ? " he demanded of the little prince .
" What does that mean - - ' admire ' ? "
" To admire mean that you regard me as the handsomest , the best - dressed , the richest , and the most intelligent man on this planet . "
" But you are the only man on your planet ! "
" Do me this kindness .
Admire me just the same . "
" I admire you , " said the little prince , shrugging his shoulders slightly , " but what is there in that to interest you so much ? "
And the little prince went away .
" The grown - ups are certainly very odd , " he said to himself , as he continued on his journey .
Chapter 12 .
The next planet was inhabited by a tippler .
This was a very short visit , but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection .
" What are you doing there ? " he said to the tippler , whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles .
" I am drinking , " replied the tippler , with a lugubrious air .
" Why are you drinking ? " demanded the little prince .
" So that I may forget , " replied the tippler .
" Forget what ? " inquired the little prince , who already was sorry for him .
" Forget that I am ashamed , " the tippler confessed , hanging his head .
" Ashamed of what ? " insisted the little prince , who wanted to help him .
" Ashamed of drinking ! "
The tippler brought his speech to an end , and shut himself up in an impregnable silence .
And the little prince went away , puzzled .
" The grown - ups are certainly very , very odd , " he said to himself , as he continued on his journey .
Chapter 13 .
The fourth planet belonged to a businessman .
This man was so much occupied that he did not even raise his head at the little prince 's arrival .
" Good morning , " the little prince said to him .
" Your cigarette has gone out . "
" Three and two make five .
Five and seven make twelve .
Twelve and three make fifteen .
Good morning .
FIfteen and seven make twenty - two .
Twenty - two and six make twenty - eight .
I have n't time to light it again .
Twenty - six and five make thirty - one .
Phew !
Then that makes five - hundred - and - one - million , six - hundred - twenty - two - thousand , seven - hundred - thirty - one . "
" Five hundred million what ? " asked the little prince .
" Eh ?
Are you still there ?
Five - hundred - and - one million - - I can n't stop ...
I have so much to do !
I am concerned with matters of consequence .
I do n't amuse myself with balderdash .
Two and five make seven ... "
" Five - hundred - and - one million what ? " repeated the little prince , who never in his life had let go of a question once he had asked it .
The businessman raised his head .
" During the fifty - four years that I have inhabited this planet , I have been disturbed only three times .
The first time was twenty - two years ago , when some giddy goose fell from goodness knows where .
He made the most frightful noise that resounded all over the place , and I made four mistakes in my addition .
The second time , eleven years ago , I was disturbed by an attack of rheumatism .
I do n't get enough exercise .
I have no time for loafing .
The third time - - well , this is it !
I was saying , then , five - hundred - and - one millions - - "
" Millions of what ? "
The businessman suddenly realized that there was no hope of being left in peace until he answered this question .
" Millions of those little objects , " he said , " which one sometimes sees in the sky . "
" Flies ? "
" Oh , no .
Little glittering objects . "
" Bees ? "
" Oh , no .
Little golden objects that set lazy men to idle dreaming .
As for me , I am concerned with matters of consequence .
There is no time for idle dreaming in my life . "
" Ah !
You mean the stars ? "
" Yes , that 's it .
The stars . "
" And what do you do with five - hundred millions of stars ? "
" Five - hundred - and - one million , six - hundred - twenty - two thousand , seven - hundred - thirty - one .
I am concerned with matters of consequence : I am accurate . "
" And what do you do with these stars ? "
" What do I do with them ? "
" Yes . "
" Nothing .
I own them . "
" You own the stars ? "
" Yes . "
" But I have already seen a king who - - "
" Kings do not own , they reign over .
It is a very different matter . "
" And what good does it do you to own the stars ? "
" It does me the good of making me rich . "
" And what good does it do you to be rich ? "
" It makes it possible for me to buy more stars , if any are ever discovered . "
" This man , " the little prince said to himself , " reasons a little like my poor tippler ... "
Nevertheless , he still had some more questions .
" How is it possible for one to own the stars ? "
" To whom do they belong ? " the businessman retorted , peevishly .
" I do n't know .
To nobody . "
" Then they belong to me , because I was the first person to think of it . "
" Is that all that is necessary ? "
" Certainly .
When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody , it is yours .
When you discover an island that belongs to nobody , it is yours .
When you get an idea before any one else , you take out a patent on it : it is yours .
So with me : I own the stars , because nobody else before me ever thought of owning them . "
" Yes , that is true , " said the little prince .
" And what do you do with them ? "
" I administer them , " replied the businessman .
" I count them and recount them .
It is difficult .
But I am a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence . "
The little prince was still not satisfied .
" If I owned a silk scarf , " he said , " I could put it around my neck and take it away with me .
If I owned a flower , I could pluck that flower and take it away with me .
But you can not pluck the stars from heaven ... "
" No .
But I can put them in the bank . "
" Whatever does that mean ? "
" That means that I write the number of my stars on a little paper .
And then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key . "
" And that is all ? "
" That is enough , " said the businessman .
" It is entertaining , " thought the little prince .
" It is rather poetic .
But it is of no great consequence . "
On matters of consequence , the little prince had ideas which were very different from those of the grown - ups .
" I myself own a flower , " he continued his conversation with the businessman , " which I water every day .
I own three volcanoes , which I clean out every week ( for I also clean out the one that is extinct ; one never knows ) .
It is of some use to my volcanoes , and it is of some use to my flower , that I own them .
But you are of no use to the stars ... "
The businessman opened his mouth , but he found nothing to say in answer .
And the little prince went away .
" The grown - ups are certainly altogether extraordinary , " he said simply , talking to himself as he continued on his journey .
Chapter 14 .
The fifth planet was very strange .
It was the smallest of all .
There was just enough room on it for a street lamp and a lamplighter .
The little prince was not able to reach any explanation of the use of a street lamp and a lamplighter , somewhere in the heavens , on a planet which had no people , and not one house .
But he said to himself , nevertheless : " It may well be that this man is absurd .
But he is not so absurd as the king , the conceited man , the businessman , and the tippler .
For at least his work has some meaning .
When he lights his street lamp , it is as if he brought one more star to life , or one flower .
When he puts out his lamp , he sends the flower , or the star , to sleep .
That is a beautiful occupation .
And since it is beautiful , it is truly useful . "
When he arrived on the planet he respectfully saluted the lamplighter .
" Good morning .
Why have you just put out your lamp ? "
" Those are the orders , " replied the lamplighter .
" Good morning . "
" What are the orders ? "
" The orders are that I put out my lamp .
Good evening . "
And he lighted his lamp again .
" But why have you just lighted it again ? "
" Those are the orders , " replied the lamplighter .
" I do not understand , " said the little prince .
" There is nothing to understand , " said the lamplighter .
" Orders are orders .
Good morning . "
And he put out his lamp .
Then he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red squares .
" I follow a terrible profession .
In the old days it was reasonable .
I put the lamp out in the morning , and in the evening I lighted it again .
I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for sleep . "
" And the orders have been changed since that time ? "
" The orders have not been changed , " said the lamplighter .
" That is the tragedy !
From year to year the planet has turned more rapidly and the orders have not been changed ! "
" Then what ? " asked the little prince .
" Then - - the planet now makes a complete turn every minute , and I no longer have a single second for repose .
Once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out ! "
" That is very funny !
A day lasts only one minute , here where you live ! "
" It is not funny at all ! " said the lamplighter .
" While we have been talking together a month has gone by . "
" A month ? "
" Yes , a month .
Thirty minutes .
Thirty days .
Good evening . "
And he lighted his lamp again .
As the little prince watched him , he felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders .
He remembered the sunsets which he himself had gone to seek , in other days , merely by pulling up his chair ; and he wanted to help his friend .
" You know , " he said , " I can tell you a way you can rest whenever you want to ... "
" I always want to rest , " said the lamplighter .
For it is possible for a man to be faithful and lazy at the same time .
The little prince went on with his explanation : " Your planet is so small that three strides will take you all the way around it .
To be always in the sunshine , you need only walk along rather slowly .
When you want to rest , you will walk - - and the day will last as long as you like . "
" That does n't do me much good , " said the lamplighter .
" The one thing I love in life is to sleep . "
" Then you 're unlucky , " said the little prince .
" I am unlucky , " said the lamplighter .
" Good morning . "
And he put out his lamp .
" That man , " said the little prince to himself , as he continued farther on his journey , " that man would be scorned by all the others : by the king , by the conceited man , by the tippler , by the businessman .
Nevertheless he is the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous .
Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself . "
He breathed a sigh of regret , and said to himself , again : " That man is the only one of them all whom I could have made my friend .
But his planet is indeed too small .
There is no room on it for two people ... "
What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave this planet , because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets !
Chapter 15 .
The sixth planet was ten times larger than the last one .
It was inhabited by an old gentleman who wrote voluminous books .
" Oh , look !
Here is an explorer ! " he exclaimed to himself when he saw the little prince coming .
The little prince sat down on the table and panted a little .
He had already traveled so much and so far !
" Where do you come from ? " the old gentleman said to him .
" What is that big book ? " said the little prince .
" What are you doing ? "
" I am a geographer , " the old gentleman said to him .
" What is a geographer ? " asked the little prince .
" A geographer is a scholar who knows the location of all the seas , rivers , towns , mountains , and deserts . "
" That is very interesting , " said the little prince .
" Here at last is a man who has a real profession ! "
And he cast a look around him at the planet of the geographer .
It was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever seen .
" Your planet is very beautiful , " he said .
" Has it any oceans ? "
" I could n't tell you , " said the geographer .
" Ah ! "
The little prince was disappointed .
" Has it any mountains ? "
" I could n't tell you , " said the geographer .
" And towns , and rivers , and deserts ? "
" I could n't tell you that , either . "
" But you are a geographer ! "
" Exactly , " the geographer said .
" But I am not an explorer .
I have n't a single explorer on my planet .
It is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns , the rivers , the mountains , the seas , the oceans , and the deserts .
The geographer is much too important to go loafing about .
He does not leave his desk .
But he receives the explorers in his study .
He asks them questions , and he notes down what they recall of their travels .
And if the recollections of any one among them seem interesting to him , the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer 's moral character . "
" Why is that ? "
" Because an explorer who told lies would bring disaster on the books of the geographer .
So would an explorer who drank too much . "
" Why is that ? " asked the little prince .
" Because intoxicated men see double .
Then the geographer would note down two mountains in a place where there was only one . "
" I know some one , " said the little prince , " who would make a bad explorer . "
" That is possible .
Then , when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good , an inquiry is ordered into his discovery . "
" One goes to see it ? "
" No .
That would be too complicated .
But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs .
For example , if the discovery in question is that of a large mountain , one requires that large stones be brought back from it . "
The geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement .
" But you - - you come from far away !
You are an explorer !
You shall describe your planet to me ! "
And , having opened his big register , the geographer sharpened his pencil .
The recitals of explorers are put down first in pencil .
One waits until the explorer has furnished proofs , before putting them down in ink .
" Well ? " said the geographer expectantly .
" Oh , where I live , " said the little prince , " it is not very interesting .
It is all so small .
I have three volcanoes .
Two volcanoes are active and the other is extinct .
But one never knows . "
" One never knows , " said the geographer .
" I have also a flower . "
" We do not record flowers , " said the geographer .
" Why is that ?
The flower is the most beautiful thing on my planet ! "
" We do not record them , " said the geographer , " because they are ephemeral . "
" What does that mean - - ' ephemeral ' ? "
" Geographies , " said the geographer , " are the books which , of all books , are most concerned with matters of consequence .
They never become old - fashioned .
It is very rarely that a mountain changes its position .
It is very rarely that an ocean empties itself of its waters .
We write of eternal things . "
" But extinct volcanoes may come to life again , " the little prince interrupted .
" What does that mean - - ' ephemeral ' ? "
" Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive , it comes to the same thing for us , " said the geographer .
" The thing that matters to us is the mountain .
It does not change . "
" But what does that mean - - ' ephemeral ' ? " repeated the little prince , who never in his life had let go of a question , once he had asked it .
" It means , ' which is in danger of speedy disappearance . ' "
" Is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance ? "
" Certainly it is . "
" My flower is ephemeral , " the little prince said to himself , " and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world .
And I have left her on my planet , all alone ! "
That was his first moment of regret .
But he took courage once more .
" What place would you advise me to visit now ? " he asked .
" The planet Earth , " replied the geographer .
" It has a good reputation . "
And the little prince went away , thinking of his flower .
Chapter 16 .
So then the seventh planet was the Earth .
The Earth is not just an ordinary planet !
One can count , there 111 kings ( not forgetting , to be sure , the Negro kings among them ) , 7000 geographers , 900,000 businessmen , 7,500,000 tipplers , 311,000,000 conceited men - - that is to say , about 2,000,000,000 grown - ups .
To give you an idea of the size of the Earth , I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain , over the whole of the six continents , a veritable army of 462,511 lamplighters for the street lamps .
Seen from a slight distance , that would make a splendid spectacle .
The movements of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera .
First would come the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia .
Having set their lamps alight , these would go off to sleep .
Next , the lamplighters of China and Siberia would enter for their steps in the dance , and then they too would be waved back into the wings .
After that would come the turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies ; then those of Africa and Europe , then those of South America ; then those of South America ; then those of North America .
And never would they make a mistake in the order of their entry upon the stage .
It would be magnificent .
Only the man who was in charge of the single lamp at the North Pole , and his colleague who was responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole - - only these two would live free from toil and care : they would be busy twice a year .
Chapter 17 .
When one wishes to play the wit , he sometimes wanders a little from the truth .
I have not been altogether honest in what I have told you about the lamplighters .
And I realize that I run the risk of giving a false idea of our planet to those who do not know it .
Men occupy a very small place upon the Earth .
If the two billion inhabitants who people its surface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together , as they do for some big public assembly , they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide .
All humanity could be piled up on a small Pacific islet .
The grown - ups , to be sure , will not believe you when you tell them that .
They imagine that they fill a great deal of space .
They fancy themselves as important as the baobabs .
You should advise them , then , to make their own calculations .
They adore figures , and that will please them .
But do not waste your time on this extra task .
It is unnecessary .
You have , I know , confidence in me .
When the little prince arrived on the Earth , he was very much surprised not to see any people .
He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet , when a coil of gold , the color of the moonlight , flashed across the sand .
" Good evening , " said the little prince courteously .
" Good evening , " said the snake .
" What planet is this on which I have come down ? " asked the little prince .
" This is the Earth ; this is Africa , " the snake answered .
" Ah !
Then there are no people on the Earth ? "
" This is the desert .
There are no people in the desert .
The Earth is large , " said the snake .
The little prince sat down on a stone , and raised his eyes toward the sky .
" I wonder , " he said , " whether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us may find his own again ...
Look at my planet .
It is right there above us .
But how far away it is ! "
" It is beautiful , " the snake said .
" What has brought you here ? "
" I have been having some trouble with a flower , " said the little prince .
" Ah ! " said the snake .
And they were both silent .
" Where are the men ? " the little prince at last took up the conversation again .
" It is a little lonely in the desert ... "
" It is also lonely among men , " the snake said .
The little prince gazed at him for a long time .
" You are a funny animal , " he said at last .
" You are no thicker than a finger ... "
" But I am more powerful than the finger of a king , " said the snake .
The little prince smiled .
" You are not very powerful .
You have n't even any feet .
You can not even travel ... "
" I can carry you farther than any ship could take you , " said the snake .
He twined himself around the little prince 's ankle , like a golden bracelet .
" Whomever I touch , I send back to the earth from whence he came , " the snake spoke again .
" But you are innocent and true , and you come from a star ... "
The little prince made no reply .
" You move me to pity - - you are so weak on this Earth made of granite , " the snake said .
" I can help you , some day , if you grow too homesick for your own planet .
I can - - "
" Oh !
I understand you very well , " said the little prince .
" But why do you always speak in riddles ? "
" I solve them all , " said the snake .
And they were both silent .
Chapter 18 .
The little prince crossed the desert and met with only one flower .
It was a flower with three petals , a flower of no account at all .
" Good morning , " said the little prince .
" Good morning , " said the flower .
" Where are the men ? " the little prince asked , politely .
The flower had once seen a caravan passing .
" Men ? " she echoed .
" I think there are six or seven of them in existence .
I saw them , several years ago .
But one never knows where to find them .
The wind blows them away .
They have no roots , and that makes their life very difficult . "
" Goodbye , " said the little prince .
" Goodbye , " said the flower .
Chapter 19 .
After that , the little prince climbed a high mountain .
The only mountains he had ever known were the three volcanoes , which came up to his knees .
And he used the extinct volcano as a footstool .
" From a mountain as high as this one , " he said to himself , " I shall be able to see the whole planet at one glance , and all the people ... "
But he saw nothing , save peaks of rock that were sharpened like needles .
" Good morning , " he said courteously .
" Good morning - - Good morning - - Good morning , " answered the echo .
" Who are you ? " said the little prince .
" Who are you - - Who are you - - Who are you ? " answered the echo .
" Be my friends .
I am all alone , " he said .
" I am all alone - - all alone - - all alone , " answered the echo .
" What a queer planet ! " he thought .
" It is altogether dry , and altogether pointed , and altogether harsh and forbidding .
And the people have no imagination .
They repeat whatever one says to them ...
On my planet I had a flower ; she always was the first to speak ... "
Chapter 20 .
But it happened that after walking for a long time through sand , and rocks , and snow , the little prince at last came upon a road .
And all roads lead to the abodes of men .
" Good morning , " he said .
He was standing before a garden , all a - bloom with roses .
" Good morning , " said the roses .
The little prince gazed at them .
They all looked like his flower .
" Who are you ? " he demanded , thunderstruck .
" We are roses , " the roses said .
And he was overcome with sadness .
His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe .
And here were five thousand of them , all alike , in one single garden !
" She would be very much annoyed , " he said to himself , " if she should see that ... she would cough most dreadfully , and she would pretend that she was dying , to avoid being laughed at .
And I should be obliged to pretend that I was nursing her back to life - - for if I did not do that , to humble myself also , she would really allow herself to die ... "
Then he went on with his reflections : " I thought that I was rich , with a flower that was unique in all the world ; and all I had was a common rose .
A common rose , and three volcanoes that come up to my knees - - and one of them perhaps extinct forever ... that does n't make me a very great prince ... "
And he lay down in the grass and cried .
Chapter 21 .
It was then that the fox appeared .
" Good morning , " said the fox .
" Good morning , " the little prince responded politely , although when he turned around he saw nothing .
" I am right here , " the voice said , " under the apple tree . "
" Who are you ? " asked the little prince , and added , " You are very pretty to look at . "
" I am a fox , " said the fox .
" Come and play with me , " proposed the little prince .
" I am so unhappy . "
" I can not play with you , " the fox said .
" I am not tamed . "
" Ah !
Please excuse me , " said the little prince .
But , after some thought , he added : " What does that mean - - ' tame ' ? "
" You do not live here , " said the fox .
" What is it that you are looking for ? "
" I am looking for men , " said the little prince .
" What does that mean - - ' tame ' ? "
" Men , " said the fox .
" They have guns , and they hunt .
It is very disturbing .
They also raise chickens .
These are their only interests .
Are you looking for chickens ? "
" No , " said the little prince .
" I am looking for friends .
What does that mean - - ' tame ' ? "
" It is an act too often neglected , " said the fox .
It means to establish ties . "
" ' To establish ties ' ? "
" Just that , " said the fox .
" To me , you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys .
And I have no need of you .
And you , on your part , have no need of me .
To you , I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes .
But if you tame me , then we shall need each other .
To me , you will be unique in all the world .
To you , I shall be unique in all the world ... "
" I am beginning to understand , " said the little prince .
" There is a flower ...
I think that she has tamed me ... "
" It is possible , " said the fox .
" On the Earth one sees all sorts of things . "
" Oh , but this is not on the Earth ! " said the little prince .
The fox seemed perplexed , and very curious .
" On another planet ? "
" Yes . "
" Are there hunters on this planet ? "
" No . "
" Ah , that is interesting !
Are there chickens ? "
" No . "
" Nothing is perfect , " sighed the fox .
But he came back to his idea .
" My life is very monotonous , " the fox said .
" I hunt chickens ; men hunt me .
All the chickens are just alike , and all the men are just alike .
And , in consequence , I am a little bored .
But if you tame me , it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life .
I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others .
Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground .
Yours will call me , like music , out of my burrow .
And then look : you see the grain - fields down yonder ?
I do not eat bread .
Wheat is of no use to me .
The wheat fields have nothing to say to me .
And that is sad .
But you have hair that is the colour of gold .
Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me !
The grain , which is also golden , will bring me back the thought of you .
And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat ... "
The fox gazed at the little prince , for a long time .
" Please - - tame me ! " he said .
" I want to , very much , " the little prince replied .
" But I have not much time .
I have friends to discover , and a great many things to understand . "
" One only understands the things that one tames , " said the fox .
" Men have no more time to understand anything .
They buy things all ready made at the shops .
But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship , and so men have no friends any more .
If you want a friend , tame me ... "
" What must I do , to tame you ? " asked the little prince .
" You must be very patient , " replied the fox .
" First you will sit down at a little distance from me - - like that - - in the grass .
I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye , and you will say nothing .
Words are the source of misunderstandings .
But you will sit a little closer to me , every day ... "
The next day the little prince came back .
" It would have been better to come back at the same hour , " said the fox .
" If , for example , you come at four o'clock in the afternoon , then at three o'clock I shall begin to be happy .
I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances .
At four o'clock , I shall already be worrying and jumping about .
I shall show you how happy I am !
But if you come at just any time , I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you ...
One must observe the proper rites ... "
" What is a rite ? " asked the little prince .
" Those also are actions too often neglected , " said the fox .
" They are what make one day different from other days , one hour from other hours .
There is a rite , for example , among my hunters .
Every Thursday they dance with the village girls .
So Thursday is a wonderful day for me !
I can take a walk as far as the vineyards .
But if the hunters danced at just any time , every day would be like every other day , and I should never have any vacation at all . "
So the little prince tamed the fox .
And when the hour of his departure drew near - - " Ah , " said the fox , " I shall cry . "
" It is your own fault , " said the little prince .
" I never wished you any sort of harm ; but you wanted me to tame you ... "
" Yes , that is so , " said the fox .
" But now you are going to cry ! " said the little prince .
" Yes , that is so , " said the fox .
" Then it has done you no good at all ! "
" It has done me good , " said the fox , " because of the color of the wheat fields . "
And then he added : " Go and look again at the roses .
You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world .
Then come back to say goodbye to me , and I will make you a present of a secret . "
The little prince went away , to look again at the roses .
" You are not at all like my rose , " he said .
" As yet you are nothing .
No one has tamed you , and you have tamed no one .
You are like my fox when I first knew him .
He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes .
But I have made him my friend , and now he is unique in all the world . "
And the roses were very much embarassed .
" You are beautiful , but you are empty , " he went on .
" One could not die for you .
To be sure , an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you - - the rose that belongs to me .
But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses : because it is she that I have watered ; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe ; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen ; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars ( except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies ) ; because it is she that I have listened to , when she grumbled , or boasted , or ever sometimes when she said nothing .
Because she is my rose .
And he went back to meet the fox .
" Goodbye , " he said .
" Goodbye , " said the fox .
" And now here is my secret , a very simple secret : It is only with the heart that one can see rightly ; what is essential is invisible to the eye . "
" What is essential is invisible to the eye , " the little prince repeated , so that he would be sure to remember .
" It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important . "
" It is the time I have wasted for my rose - - " said the little prince , so that he would be sure to remember .
" Men have forgotten this truth , " said the fox .
" But you must not forget it .
You become responsible , forever , for what you have tamed .
You are responsible for your rose ... "
" I am responsible for my rose , " the little prince repeated , so that he would be sure to remember .
Chapter 22 .
" Good morning , " said the little prince .
" Good morning , " said the railway switchman .
" What do you do here ? " the little prince asked .
" I sort out travelers , in bundles of a thousand , " said the switchman .
" I send off the trains that carry them ; now to the right , now to the left . "
And a brilliantly lighted express train shook the switchman 's cabin as it rushed by with a roar like thunder .
" They are in a great hurry , " said the little prince .
" What are they looking for ? "
" Not even the locomotive engineer knows that , " said the switchman .
And a second brilliantly lighted express thundered by , in the opposite direction .
" Are they coming back already ? " demanded the little prince .
" These are not the same ones , " said the switchman .
" It is an exchange . "
" Were they not satisfied where they were ? " asked the little prince .
" No one is ever satisfied where he is , " said the switchman .
And they heard the roaring thunder of a third brilliantly lighted express .
" Are they pursuing the first travelers ? " demanded the little prince .
" They are pursuing nothing at all , " said the switchman .
" They are asleep in there , or if they are not asleep they are yawning .
Only the children are flattening their noses against the windowpanes . "
" Only the children know what they are looking for , " said the little prince .
" They waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to them ; and if anybody takes it away from them , they cry ... "
" They are lucky , " the switchman said .
Chapter 23 .
" Good morning , " said the little prince .
" Good morning , " said the merchant .
This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst .
You need only swallow one pill a week , and you would feel no need of anything to drink .
" Why are you selling those ? " asked the little prince .
" Because they save a tremendous amount of time , " said the merchant .
" Computations have been made by experts .
With these pills , you save fifty - three minutes in every week . "
" And what do I do with those fifty - three minutes ? "
" Anything you like ... "
" As for me , " said the little prince to himself , " if I had fifty - three minutes to spend as I liked , I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water . "
Chapter 24 .
It was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert , and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I was drinking the last drop of my water supply .
" Ah , "
I said to the little prince , " these memories of yours are very charming ; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane ; I have nothing more to drink ; and I , too , should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water ! "
" My friend the fox - - " the little prince said to me .
" My dear little man , this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox ! "
" Why not ? "
" Because I am about to die of thirst ... "
He did not follow my reasoning , and he answered me : " It is a good thing to have had a friend , even if one is about to die .
I , for instance , am very glad to have had a fox as a friend ... "
" He has no way of guessing the danger , "
I said to myself .
" He has never been either hungry or thirsty .
A little sunshine is all he needs ... "
But he looked at me steadily , and replied to my thought : " I am thirsty , too .
Let us look for a well ... "
I made a gesture of weariness .
It is absurd to look for a well , at random , in the immensity of the desert .
But nevertheless we started walking .
When we had trudged along for several hours , in silence , the darkness fell , and the stars began to come out .
Thirst had made me a little feverish , and I looked at them as if I were in a dream .
The little prince 's last words came reeling back into my memory : " Then you are thirsty , too ? "
I demanded .
But he did not reply to my question .
He merely said to me : " Water may also be good for the heart ... "
I did not understand this answer , but I said nothing .
I knew very well that it was impossible to cross - examine him .
He was tired .
He sat down .
I sat down beside him .
And , after a little silence , he spoke again : " The stars are beautiful , because of a flower that can not be seen . "
I replied , " Yes , that is so . "
And , without saying anything more , I looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out before us in the moonlight .
" The desert is beautiful , " the little prince added .
And that was true .
I have always loved the desert .
One sits down on a desert sand dune , sees nothing , hears nothing .
Yet through the silence something throbs , and gleams ...
" What makes the desert beautiful , " said the little prince , " is that somewhere it hides a well ... "
I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands .
When I was a little boy I lived in an old house , and legend told us that a treasure was buried there .
To be sure , no one had ever known how to find it ; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it .
But it cast an enchantment over that house .
My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart ...
" Yes , "
I said to the little prince .
" The house , the stars , the desert - - what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible ! "
" I am glad , " he said , " that you agree with my fox . "
As the little prince dropped off to sleep , I took him in my arms and set out walking once more .
I felt deeply moved , and stirred .
It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure .
It seemed to me , even , that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth .
In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead , his closed eyes , his locks of hair that trembled in the wind , and I said to myself : " What I see here is nothing but a shell .
What is most important is invisible ... "
As his lips opened slightly with the suspicious of a half - smile , I said to myself , again : " What moves me so deeply , about this little prince who is sleeping here , is his loyalty to a flower - - the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp , even when he is asleep ... "
And I felt him to be more fragile still .
I felt the need of protecting him , as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind ...
And , as I walked on so , I found the well , at daybreak .
Chapter 25 .
" Men , " said the little prince , " set out on their way in express trains , but they do not know what they are looking for .
Then they rush about , and get excited , and turn round and round ... "
And he added : " It is not worth the trouble ... "
The well that we had come to was not like the wells of the Sahara .
The wells of the Sahara are mere holes dug in the sand .
This one was like a well in a village .
But there was no village here , and I thought I must be dreaming ...
" It is strange , "
I said to the little prince .
" Everything is ready for use : the pulley , the bucket , the rope ... "
He laughed , touched the rope , and set the pulley to working .
And the pulley moaned , like an old weathervane which the wind has long since forgotten .
" Do you hear ? " said the little prince .
" We have wakened the well , and it is singing ... "
I did not want him to tire himself with the rope .
" Leave it to me , "
I said .
" It is too heavy for you . "
I hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it there - - happy , tired as I was , over my achievement .
The song of the pulley was still in my ears , and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water .
" I am thirsty for this water , " said the little prince .
" Give me some of it to drink ... "
And I understood what he had been looking for .
I raised the bucket to his lips .
He drank , his eyes closed .
It was as sweet as some special festival treat .
This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment .
Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars , the song of the pulley , the effort of my arms .
It was good for the heart , like a present .
When I was a little boy , the lights of the Christmas tree , the music of the Midnight Mass , the tenderness of smiling faces , used to make up , so , the radiance of the gifts I received .
" The men where you live , " said the little prince , " raise five thousand roses in the same garden - - and they do not find in it what they are looking for . "
" They do not find it , "
I replied .
" And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose , or in a little water . "
" Yes , that is true , "
I said .
And the little prince added : " But the eyes are blind .
One must look with the heart ... "
I had drunk the water .
I breathed easily .
At sunrise the sand is the color of honey .
And that honey color was making me happy , too .
What brought me , then , this sense of grief ?
" You must keep your promise , " said the little prince , softly , as he sat down beside me once more .
" What promise ? "
" You know - - a muzzle for my sheep ...
I am responsible for this flower ... "
I took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket .
The little prince looked them over , and laughed as he said : " Your baobabs - - they look a little like cabbages . "
" Oh ! "
I had been so proud of my baobabs !
" Your fox - - his ears look a little like horns ; and they are too long . "
And he laughed again .
" You are not fair , little prince , "
I said .
" I do n't know how to draw anything except boa constrictors from the outside and boa constrictors from the inside . "
" Oh , that will be all right , " he said , " children understand . "
So then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle .
And as I gave it to him my heart was torn .
" You have plans that I do not know about , "
I said .
But he did not answer me .
He said to me , instead : " You know - - my descent to the earth ...
Tomorrow will be its anniversary . "
Then , after a silence , he went on : " I came down very near here . "
And he flushed .
And once again , without understanding why , I had a queer sense of sorrow .
One question , however , occurred to me : " Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you - - a week ago - - you were strolling along like that , all alone , a thousand miles from any inhabited region ?
You were on the your back to the place where you landed ? "
The little prince flushed again .
And I added , with some hesitancy : " Perhaps it was because of the anniversary ? "
The little prince flushed once more .
He never answered questions - - but when one flushes does that not mean " Yes " ?
" Ah , "
I said to him , " I am a little frightened - - "
But he interrupted me .
" Now you must work .
You must return to your engine .
I will be waiting for you here .
Come back tomorrow evening ... "
But I was not reassured .
I remembered the fox .
One runs the risk of weeping a little , if one lets himself be tamed ...
Chapter 26 .
Beside the well there was the ruin of an old stone wall .
When I came back from my work , the next evening , I saw from some distance away my little price sitting on top of a wall , with his feet dangling .
And I heard him say : " Then you do n't remember .
This is not the exact spot . "
Another voice must have answered him , for he replied to it : " Yes , yes !
It is the right day , but this is not the place . "
I continued my walk toward the wall .
At no time did I see or hear anyone .
The little prince , however , replied once again : " -- Exactly .
You will see where my track begins , in the sand .
You have nothing to do but wait for me there .
I shall be there tonight . "
I was only twenty metres from the wall , and I still saw nothing .
After a silence the little prince spoke again : " You have good poison ?
You are sure that it will not make me suffer too long ? "
I stopped in my tracks , my heart torn asunder ; but still I did not understand .
" Now go away , " said the little prince .
" I want to get down from the wall . "
I dropped my eyes , then , to the foot of the wall - - and I leaped into the air .
There before me , facing the little prince , was one of those yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to an end .
Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back .
But , at the noise I made , the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain , and , in no apparent hurry , disappeared , with a light metallic sound , among the stones .
I reached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms ; his face was white as snow .
" What does this mean ? "
I demanded .
" Why are you talking with snakes ? "
I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore .
I had moistened his temples , and had given him some water to drink .
And now I did not dare ask him any more questions .
He looked at me very gravely , and put his arms around my neck .
I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird , shot with someone 's rifle ...
" I am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine , " he said .
" Now you can go back home - - "
" How do you know about that ? "
I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful , beyond anything that I had dared to hope .
He made no answer to my question , but he added : " I , too , am going back home today ... "
Then , sadly - - " It is much farther ... it is much more difficult ... "
I realised clearly that something extraordinary was happening .
I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child ; and yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing to restrain him ...
His look was very serious , like some one lost far away .
" I have your sheep .
And I have the sheep 's box .
And I have the muzzle ... "
And he gave me a sad smile .
I waited a long time .
I could see that he was reviving little by little .
" Dear little man , "
I said to him , " you are afraid ... "
He was afraid , there was no doubt about that .
But he laughed lightly .
" I shall be much more afraid this evening ... "
Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable .
And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more .
For me , it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert .
" Little man , "
I said , " I want to hear you laugh again . "
But he said to me : " Tonight , it will be a year ... my star , then , can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth , a year ago ... "
" Little man , "
I said , " tell me that it is only a bad dream - - this affair of the snake , and the meeting - place , and the star ... "
But he did not answer my plea .
He said to me , instead : " The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen ... "
" Yes , I know ... "
" It is just as it is with the flower .
If you love a flower that lives on a star , it is sweet to look at the sky at night .
All the stars are a - bloom with flowers ... "
" Yes , I know ... "
" It is just as it is with the water .
Because of the pulley , and the rope , what you gave me to drink was like music .
You remember - - how good it was . "
" Yes , I know ... "
" And at night you will look up at the stars .
Where I live everything is so small that I can not show you where my star is to be found .
It is better , like that .
My star will just be one of the stars , for you .
And so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens ... they will all be your friends .
And , besides , I am going to make you a present ... "
He laughed again .
" Ah , little prince , dear little prince !
I love to hear that laughter ! "
" That is my present .
Just that .
It will be as it was when we drank the water ... "
" What are you trying to say ? "
" All men have the stars , " he answered , " but they are not the same things for different people .
For some , who are travelers , the stars are guides .
For others they are no more than little lights in the sky .
For others , who are scholars , they are problems .
For my businessman they were wealth .
But all these stars are silent .
You - - you alone - - will have the stars as no one else has them - - "
" What are you trying to say ? "
" In one of the stars I shall be living .
In one of them I shall be laughing .
And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing , when you look at the sky at night ... you - - only you - - will have stars that can laugh ! "
And he laughed again .
" And when your sorrow is comforted ( time soothes all sorrows ) you will be content that you have known me .
You will always be my friend .
You will want to laugh with me .
And you will sometimes open your window , so , for that pleasure ... and your friends will be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky !
Then you will say to them , ' Yes , the stars always make me laugh ! ' And they will think you are crazy .
It will be a very shabby trick that I shall have played on you ... "
And he laughed again .
" It will be as if , in place of the stars , I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh ... "
And he laughed again .
Then he quickly became serious : " Tonight - - you know ... do not come , " said the little prince .
" I shall not leave you , "
I said .
" I shall look as if I were suffering .
I shall look a little as if I were dying .
It is like that .
Do not come to see that .
It is not worth the trouble ... "
" I shall not leave you . "
But he was worried .
" I tell you - - it is also because of the snake .
He must not bite you .
Snakes - - they are malicious creatures .
This one might bite you just for fun ... "
" I shall not leave you . "
But a thought came to reassure him : " It is true that they have no more poison for a second bite . "
That night I did not see him set out on his way .
He got away from me without making a sound .
When I succeeded in catching up with him he was walking along with a quick and resolute step .
He said to me merely : " Ah !
You are there ... "
And he took me by the hand .
But he was still worrying .
" It was wrong of you to come .
You will suffer .
I shall look as if I were dead ; and that will not be true ... "
I said nothing .
" You understand ... it is too far .
I can not carry this body with me .
It is too heavy . "
I said nothing .
" But it will be like an old abandoned shell .
There is nothing sad about old shells ... "
I said nothing .
He was a little discouraged .
But he made one more effort : " You know , it will be very nice .
I , too , shall look at the stars .
All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley .
All the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink ... "
I said nothing .
" That will be so amusing !
You will have five hundred million little bells , and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water ... "
And he too said nothing more , because he was crying ...
" Here it is .
Let me go on by myself . "
And he sat down , because he was afraid .
Then he said , again : " You know - - my flower ...
I am responsible for her .
And she is so weak !
She is so naïve !
She has four thorns , of no use at all , to protect herself against all the world ... "
I too sat down , because I was not able to stand up any longer .
" There now - - that is all ... "
He still hesitated a little ; then he got up .
He took one step .
I could not move .
There was nothing but a flash of yellow close to his ankle .
He remained motionless for an instant .
He did not cry out .
He fell as gently as a tree falls .
There was not even any sound , because of the sand .
Chapter 27 .
And now six years have already gone by ...
I have never yet told this story .
The companions who met me on my return were well content to see me alive .
I was sad , but I told them : " I am tired . "
Now my sorrow is comforted a little .
That is to say - - not entirely .
But I know that he did go back to his planet , because I did not find his body at daybreak .
It was not such a heavy body ... and at night I love to listen to the stars .
It is like five hundred million little bells ...
But there is one extraordinary thing ... when I drew the muzzle for the little prince , I forgot to add the leather strap to it .
He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep .
So now I keep wondering : what is happening on his planet ?
Perhaps the sheep has eaten the flower ...
At one time I say to myself : " Surely not !
The little prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night , and he watches over his sheep very carefully ... "
Then I am happy .
And there is sweetness in the laughter of all the stars .
But at another time I say to myself : " At some moment or other one is absent - minded , and that is enough !
On some one evening he forgot the glass globe , or the sheep got out , without making any noise , in the night ... "
And then the little bells are changed to tears ...
Here , then , is a great mystery .
For you who also love the little prince , and for me , nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere , we do not know where , a sheep that we never saw has - - yes or no ? -- eaten a rose ...
Look up at the sky .
Ask yourselves : is it yes or no ?
Has the sheep eaten the flower ?
And you will see how everything changes ...
And no grown - up will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance !
This is , to me , the loveliest and saddest landscape in the world .
It is the same as that on the preceding page , but I have drawn it again to impress it on your memory .
It is here that the little prince appeared on Earth , and disappeared .
Look at it carefully so that you will be sure to recognise it in case you travel some day to the African desert .
And , if you should come upon this spot , please do not hurry on .
Wait for a time , exactly under the star .
Then , if a little man appears who laughs , who has golden hair and who refuses to answer questions , you will know who he is .
If this should happen , please comfort me .
Send me word that he has come back .
